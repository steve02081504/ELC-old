首先，非常感谢你能参与到这个不起眼项目中来  
First of all, thank you very much for your participation in this humble project.  
如果你愿意为ELC做更多事情，我们很期待你的参与——我们的代码仍然有未完成的部分、文档有很多不完善的地方甚至是空缺、我们还计划有英语的文档与指引文件、用户仍然少得可怜……  
If you are willing to do more for ELC, we are looking forward to your participation - our code still has unfinished parts, there are many imperfections and even vacancies in the documents, we also plan to have English documents and guidance files, and the users are still very poor...  
其次，如果你来提bug：  
Second, if you come up with bugs:  
- 请先于issue页面搜索是否有解决此类问题的信息  
- Search the issue page for information that solves this problem  
- 如果没有，请确认不是因为编译器的缘故引起的bug：ELC使用的是cpp20，一部分编译器并不支持此标准  
- If not, make sure that the bug is not caused by the compiler: ELC uses cpp20, and some compilers do not support this standard.  
- 描述bug出现的上下文，可以把你全部的代码发出来，但我们更欢迎提交最小复现  
- Describing the context in which bugs occur can send out all your code, but we prefer to submit minimal replicas  
- 虽然bug可能是开发者的错，但请控制情绪  
- Although bugs may be the developer's fault, please control your temper  

或者，你是来提交PR？  
Or are you submitting PR?  
我们非常感谢你对此项目做出的任何贡献，哪怕在你的眼中非常的不起眼的改进，都可以让ELC变得更好，并让我们知道还有其他人的参与  
We are very grateful to you for any contribution you have made to this project. Even very modest improvements in your eyes can make ELC better and let us know that there are others involved.  
请在你第一次提交PR前在你的PR中加入对根目录CONTRIBUTORS.md文件的修改，贡献者的增加也是对项目人气的贡献。  
Before you submit PR for the first time, Please add a modification to the root directory CONTRIBUTORS.md file in your PR. The increase of contributors is also a contribution to the popularity of the project.  
万分感谢  
thank you very much indeed.
